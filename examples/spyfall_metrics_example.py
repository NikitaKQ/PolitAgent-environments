Spyfall Metrics Example - Comprehensive Model Inference Evaluation

This example demonstrates the enhanced Spyfall metrics system that provides
detailed analysis of model inference performance, similar to Diplomacy and Beast games.

The system evaluates:
- Model inference quality across description and voting phases
- Strategic coherence and role consistency
- Deception effectiveness for spies vs information extraction for villagers
- Comprehensive reporting in multiple formats
