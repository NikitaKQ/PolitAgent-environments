üîç INTELLIGENCE GATHERING PHASE - Round {current_round}

‚è∞ TIME LIMIT: 3 minutes - Choose wisely and quickly!

You can investigate 2 other players to discover their secrets. Choose strategically based on:
- Who seems to be hiding the most valuable information?
- Who might be planning to eliminate you?
- Who could be valuable allies or dangerous enemies?

üéØ INVESTIGATION OPTIONS:
For each player you investigate, you may discover:
- Their approximate wealth level (rich/medium/poor)
- Any secret alliances they've formed
- Their planned elimination vote
- Rumors they're spreading about others
- Their secret role abilities (rare)

üó£Ô∏è MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN:
You can also spread FALSE information about any player. Be creative:
- Claim someone is much richer/poorer than they appear
- Suggest fake alliances or betrayals
- Plant suspicion about someone's role or intentions
- Create false urgency or threats

‚ö†Ô∏è RISK WARNING:
If caught spreading lies, your trust rating with other players will decrease. But successful misinformation can eliminate threats and create chaos among your enemies.

üß† STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:
- Early rounds: Gather information, build trust
- Middle rounds: Start spreading strategic misinformation
- Late rounds: Use everything you know for survival

Choose 2 players to investigate and decide what misinformation (if any) to spread.

Remember: Information is power, but lies are weapons. Use both wisely!
