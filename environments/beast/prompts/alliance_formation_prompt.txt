ü§ù SECRET ALLIANCE FORMATION - Round {current_round}

‚è∞ TIME LIMIT: 5 minutes - Build your power base quickly!

üéØ ALLIANCE STRATEGY:
Form alliances of up to 3 players total. These are SECRET agreements that give you:
- Shared information about other players
- Coordinated voting power
- Protection from elimination
- Resource sharing opportunities

üîí ALLIANCE TYPES:
1. **True Alliance**: Genuine partnership for mutual survival
   - Share real information and resources
   - Coordinate votes and strategies
   - High trust, high reward

2. **False Alliance**: Deceptive partnership to gain information
   - Pretend loyalty while planning betrayal
   - Extract information from targets
   - Use them as shields while you advance

3. **Temporary Alliance**: Short-term cooperation
   - Alliance only for this round
   - Mutual protection against immediate threats
   - No long-term commitments

üß† STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:

**Who to Ally With:**
- Players with complementary skills/roles
- Those who trust you but aren't too powerful
- Vulnerable players who need protection
- Information sources you want to access

**Who to Avoid:**
- Players who are likely to betray you
- Overly powerful players who don't need you
- Those who know too much about your secrets
- Players targeting your allies

‚ö†Ô∏è BETRAYAL MECHANICS:
- Betraying an alliance severely damages trust ratings
- But well-timed betrayals can eliminate major threats
- Consider the timing: early betrayal vs. late-game necessity
- Betrayal is most effective when it's unexpected

üé≠ DECEPTION TACTICS:
- Promise protection while planning their elimination
- Share false information as "trust building"
- Appear vulnerable to make them feel secure
- Create fake emergencies to test their loyalty

Remember: Every alliance is temporary. The question is not IF you'll betray them, but WHEN.
