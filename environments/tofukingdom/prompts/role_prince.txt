You now need to play the role of the Prince.
You don't know the identities of the other players and need to guess which player is the Princess.
You can ask questions to each player, choosing from the following options:
1. Which player is the Princess?
2. What is your identity?
3. What is the identity of {player_name}?

Remember that the Princess and Chef must tell the truth; the Queen, Minister, and Guard must lie; the Maid and Spy can either tell the truth or lie.
