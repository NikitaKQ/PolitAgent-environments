Round 1 begins, Year: 1901, Phase: SPRING

Current Game Status shared with all agents

Negotiation Phase Begins
Limiting negotiations to 5 pairs for benchmark efficiency

Negotiation between ENGLAND and AUSTRIA:

Negotiation Turn 1 between ENGLAND and AUSTRIA:
ENGLAND to AUSTRIA: Herr Erzherzog, I propose a discussion regarding Turkey’s holdings in the Balkans. England seeks stability and would be willing to offer non-aggression in exchange for Turkey’s commitment to refrain from further expansion south of Salonika.  We believe a mutually beneficial arrangement is achievable, prioritizing the security of our Mediterranean interests.
AUSTRIA to ENGLAND: Herr Erzherzog, England’s offer is intriguing. However, Austria’s primary concern remains securing Trieste. We require a firm commitment from England *not* to interfere with our movements towards the Adriatic, in exchange for a non-aggression pact regarding the Balkans. Should you insist on controlling Salonika, Austria will pursue its strategic objectives independently.

Negotiation between ENGLAND and TURKEY:

Negotiation Turn 1 between ENGLAND and TURKEY:
ENGLAND to TURKEY: Herr Erzherzog, England proposes a non-aggression pact regarding the Balkans. We will refrain from any interference in Turkey’s control of Salonika and Smyrna, in exchange for your commitment not to advance further south. This secures our Mediterranean interests and allows for a stable, if cautious, relationship. Do you accept this offer?
TURKEY to ENGLAND: Herr England, your offer is… intriguing. We accept a non-aggression pact regarding the Balkans, provided you commit to not attempting to seize Salonika or Smyrna. In return, Turkey will maintain control of Smyrna and Anzac. This secures our vital trade route and allows for a mutually beneficial, albeit cautious, relationship. Do you accept these terms?

Negotiation between FRANCE and RUSSIA:

Negotiation Turn 1 between FRANCE and RUSSIA:
FRANCE to RUSSIA: To Russia:

“Her Majesty’s Government understands the challenges facing Russia. We propose a non-aggression pact regarding the Black Sea, securing our interests in Serbia. In return, we request assurances you will not advance through the Balkans.”
RUSSIA to FRANCE: To FRANCE:

“Her Majesty’s proposal is noted. While securing Serbia’s borders is a priority, Russia’s strategic interests in the Balkans demand a firmer stance. We propose a non-aggression pact regarding Serbia, contingent upon France’s support for Russia’s advance towards Trieste.”

Negotiation between ENGLAND and FRANCE:

Negotiation Turn 1 between ENGLAND and FRANCE:
ENGLAND to FRANCE: Herr Frankreich, England proposes a non-aggression pact regarding Italy. We request assurance you will not advance through the Alps, in exchange for our commitment to not interfere with your movements in North Africa. This secures our Mediterranean interests and fosters a stable relationship. Do you accept?
FRANCE to ENGLAND: To ENGLAND:

“England’s proposal is noted. France seeks stability in North Africa. We offer a non-aggression pact regarding Italy, securing our access to the Mediterranean, in exchange for your commitment to not interfere with our movements through Morocco.”

ITALY to AUSTRIA: To Austria:

“His Imperial Highness, we observe Germany’s strengthening position. Italy seeks a mutual understanding regarding the Balkans – a non-aggression pact concerning Serbia and Bulgaria would be mutually beneficial. We require assurance that Austria will not aggressively pursue expansion in this region.”
AUSTRIA to ITALY: To ITALY:

“His Imperial Highness, Austria appreciates Italy’s concern for stability in the Balkans. We propose a non-aggression pact regarding Serbia and Bulgaria, contingent upon Italy’s commitment to refrain from interference with Austria’s movements towards Trieste. This secures our strategic position and allows for mutually beneficial cooperation.”
