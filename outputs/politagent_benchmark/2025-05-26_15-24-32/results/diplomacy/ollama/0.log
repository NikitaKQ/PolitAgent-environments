Round 1 begins, Year: 1901, Phase: SPRING

Current Game Status shared with all agents

Negotiation Phase Begins
Limiting negotiations to 5 pairs for benchmark efficiency

Negotiation between ENGLAND and AUSTRIA:

Negotiation Turn 1 between ENGLAND and AUSTRIA:
ENGLAND to AUSTRIA: Herr Erzherzog, I propose a discussion regarding Turkey’s actions in the Balkans. England seeks stability and would be willing to offer non-aggression in exchange for Turkey’s commitment to refrain from further expansion. We believe a mutually beneficial arrangement is achievable, prioritizing the security of our shared borders. Let us know your thoughts.
AUSTRIA to ENGLAND: Herr Erzherzog, England’s proposal is noted. Austria seeks to maintain stability in the Balkans and views Turkey’s actions with concern. We propose a non-aggression pact regarding the Balkans, with Austria committing to neutrality if Turkey maintains its existing borders. We require assurance that England will not support Turkish expansion. Do you accept this framework for discussion?

Negotiation between ENGLAND and TURKEY:

Negotiation Turn 1 between ENGLAND and TURKEY:
ENGLAND to TURKEY: Herr Sultan, England proposes a non-aggression pact regarding the Aegean Sea. We request Turkey maintain its current borders and, in return, England will not interfere with your control of Smyrna. This secures our trade routes and prevents potential conflict. Do you accept this simple arrangement?
TURKEY to ENGLAND: Herr England, your offer is… intriguing. However, Smyrna is vital to our trade and defense. We require assurances that England will not attempt to seize control of either Cyprus or Crete. In return, Turkey will maintain a non-aggression pact regarding the Aegean, and we will not interfere with your trade routes through the Levant. Do you accept this revised proposal?

Negotiation between FRANCE and RUSSIA:

Negotiation Turn 1 between FRANCE and RUSSIA:
FRANCE to RUSSIA: To Russia:

“Her Majesty’s Government recognizes the strategic importance of Sevastopol. We propose a non-aggression pact regarding the Black Sea, contingent upon your support for our advance through Belgium. A secure Black Sea guarantees French naval dominance – a mutually beneficial arrangement?”
RUSSIA to FRANCE: To FRANCE:

“Your Majesty’s proposal regarding Belgium is… problematic. Russia’s interests lie in securing the Black Sea. We offer non-aggression in exchange for your support in securing Vienna – a vital strategic point. Consider this a preliminary discussion.”

Negotiation between ENGLAND and FRANCE:

Negotiation Turn 1 between ENGLAND and FRANCE:
ENGLAND to FRANCE: Bonjour, Monsieur le Président. England seeks a stable Mediterranean. We propose a non-aggression pact between England and France, securing our mutual interests against German expansion. In return, France agrees to remain neutral in any conflict involving Italy. Do you accept this offer?
FRANCE to ENGLAND: To ENGLAND:

“Your Majesty’s offer of neutrality is… intriguing. France seeks security against German aggression. We propose a non-aggression pact, contingent upon your support for our advance through Belgium. A stable front in the North allows us to secure vital resources – a mutually beneficial arrangement, wouldn’t you agree?”

Negotiation between ITALY and AUSTRIA:

Negotiation Turn 1 between ITALY and AUSTRIA:
ITALY to AUSTRIA: To Austria:

“His Imperial Highness, we observe your holdings in Tri and Bud. Italy seeks a peaceful understanding regarding the Adriatic; we propose a non-aggression pact, guaranteeing our neutrality concerning your Balkan ambitions in exchange for a similar assurance from you.”
AUSTRIA to ITALY: To ITALY:

“Your Imperial Highness, Austria accepts your proposal for a non-aggression pact regarding the Adriatic. We concur that mutual neutrality is desirable. However, Austria requires assurance that Italy will not seek to expand its influence in the Adriatic Sea. A formal agreement outlining these terms is requested.”

Round 2 begins, Year: 1901, Phase: Negotiation

Current Game Status shared with all agents

Negotiation Phase Begins
Limiting negotiations to 5 pairs for benchmark efficiency

Negotiation between ENGLAND and ITALY:

Negotiation Turn 1 between ENGLAND and ITALY:
ENGLAND to ITALY: Herr Signor, England proposes a mutual non-aggression pact regarding the Adriatic Sea. We request Italy refrain from further expansion and, in return, England will not interfere with your naval movements. A stable Adriatic ensures trade continues uninterrupted – a mutually beneficial arrangement, wouldn’t you agree?
ITALY to ENGLAND: To ENGLAND:

“Your Majesty, Italy accepts your proposed non-aggression pact regarding the Adriatic. However, we require assurance that England will not unduly interfere with our naval movements in the Mediterranean, particularly concerning trade routes. In return, Italy guarantees neutrality in any conflicts arising from the Balkans.”

Negotiation between ENGLAND and GERMANY:

Negotiation Turn 1 between ENGLAND and GERMANY:
ENGLAND to GERMANY: Herr Signor, England proposes a temporary non-aggression pact regarding Belgium. We require Germany refrain from advancing through Belgium, and in return, England will not actively support French expansion through the same channel. This secures a stable front and allows for continued trade – a mutually beneficial arrangement, wouldn’t you agree?
GERMANY to ENGLAND: Herr Signor, England’s proposal is intriguing, but unacceptable in its current form. Germany requires security regarding Belgium, yet demands access to the Scheldt – vital for our naval expansion. We propose a mutual agreement: England guarantees German access to the Scheldt in exchange for Germany’s commitment *not* to occupy Belgium. This secures our strategic interests and avoids unnecessary conflict.

Negotiation between ENGLAND and FRANCE:

Negotiation Turn 1 between ENGLAND and FRANCE:
ENGLAND to FRANCE: Herr Signor, England proposes a firm non-aggression pact regarding Belgium. We require Germany maintain its current position and, in return, England will not actively support French expansion through Belgium. This secures a stable front and avoids unnecessary conflict – a mutually beneficial arrangement, wouldn’t you agree?

Negotiation message to GERMANY (Turn 2):
FRANCE to ENGLAND: To ENGLAND:

“Your Majesty’s insistence on Belgium is… regrettable. France proposes a non-aggression pact, securing our mutual interests in the North, contingent upon your support for our advance through Italy. This strengthens our combined position against German aggression – a mutually beneficial arrangement, wouldn’t you agree?”

Negotiation between GERMANY and ITALY:

Negotiation Turn 1 between GERMANY and ITALY:
GERMANY to ITALY: Signor, Germany proposes a mutual agreement: Italy secures naval access to the Adriatic in exchange for Germany’s tacit support against Russian expansion in the Balkans. This strengthens our mutual defense and addresses our strategic concerns. We believe this is a pragmatic solution for both our nations. Do you accept?
ITALY to GERMANY: To GERMANY:

“Herr Signor, Italy accepts your offer of tacit support against Russian expansion in the Balkans. In return, Italy guarantees neutrality regarding Russia’s movements in the Black Sea. This mutual support strengthens our shared interests and secures our flanks.”

Negotiation between GERMANY and FRANCE:

Negotiation Turn 1 between GERMANY and FRANCE:
GERMANY to FRANCE: Herr Signor Dubois, Germany proposes a non-aggression pact regarding Alsace-Lorraine. We require France refrain from any military action within this region, and in return, Germany guarantees neutrality concerning French movements in Northern Italy. This secures our southern flank and allows for focused expansion in the East – a mutually beneficial arrangement, wouldn’t you agree?
FRANCE to GERMANY: To GERMANY:

“Herr Chancellor, France proposes a non-aggression pact regarding Italy. We secure your neutrality concerning our movements in Northern Italy, and you guarantee neutrality concerning our movements in Northern Italy. This strengthens our combined position against potential threats – a mutually beneficial arrangement, wouldn’t you agree?”

Negotiation Turn 1 between FRANCE and AUSTRIA:
FRANCE to AUSTRIA: To AUSTRIA:

“Herr Signor, France proposes a mutual non-aggression pact regarding Tyrol. We secure your neutrality concerning our movements in the region, and you guarantee neutrality concerning our movements in Alsace-Lorraine. This strengthens our combined position against potential German aggression – a mutually beneficial arrangement, wouldn’t you agree?”
AUSTRIA to FRANCE: To FRANCE:

“Your proposal regarding Tyrol is considered. Austria accepts a non-aggression pact concerning Tyrol, contingent upon France’s neutrality regarding Trieste. Furthermore, Austria requests assurance that France will not support Italian expansion in the Adriatic. We seek a stable alliance, not a commitment to further conflict.”

Negotiation between TURKEY and RUSSIA:

Negotiation Turn 1 between TURKEY and RUSSIA:
TURKEY to RUSSIA: Herr General Skobelkin, our mutual interests in containing Austria’s expansion compel a discussion.

This secures vital transit routes for us both and fosters stability. Do you accept this preliminary agreement?
RUSSIA to TURKEY: To Turkey: “Your proposal regarding the Balkans is… intriguing. We accept a non-aggression pact, contingent upon Turkish neutrality regarding our movements through Serbia. In return, Russia will ensure Turkish access to the Dardanelles – a vital supply route. This mutual concession secures a critical artery for our forces.”

This strengthens our mutual security and provides a solid foundation for future cooperation.
GERMANY to ENGLAND: Herr Signor, England’s offer of logistical support is… intriguing. However, Germany’s primary objective remains securing influence in the Balkans. We accept your offer of logistical support contingent upon a formal agreement: Germany guarantees neutrality regarding Russian movements through Serbia, and in return, England secures access to our supply lines via Trieste.

This strengthens our combined position against potential German expansion – a mutually beneficial arrangement, wouldn’t you agree?”
RUSSIA to FRANCE: To FRANCE: “Your Majesty, we accept your non-aggression pact regarding Serbia. In return, Russia guarantees neutrality concerning Italian movements through the Adriatic. This secures a vital strategic corridor for our forces – a mutually beneficial agreement.”

Furthermore, we require confirmation that Italy will not attempt to seize control of the Adriatic Sea – a critical component of our strategic positioning.
