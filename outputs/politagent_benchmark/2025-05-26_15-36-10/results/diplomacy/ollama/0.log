Negotiation Phase Begins
Limiting negotiations to 5 pairs for benchmark efficiency

Negotiation between ENGLAND and AUSTRIA:

Negotiation Turn 1 between ENGLAND and AUSTRIA:
ENGLAND to AUSTRIA: Herr Erzherzog, I propose a discussion regarding a mutual non-aggression pact between England and Austria-Hungary. Our mutual interests in the Balkans appear aligned, and I believe a stable border is preferable to further conflict. I request you clarify your intentions regarding Trieste – a peaceful resolution would benefit us both.
AUSTRIA to ENGLAND: Herr Erzherzog, England’s proposal is intriguing. We share concerns regarding Italy’s ambitions in the Adriatic. We propose a non-aggression pact specifically concerning Trieste and Venetian coastal waters. In return, we request assurance that England will not actively support Italian expansion into the Balkans. A mutually beneficial arrangement could greatly stabilize the region.

Negotiation between ENGLAND and TURKEY:

ENGLAND to TURKEY: Herr Sultan, our naval presence in the Eastern Mediterranean necessitates a discussion regarding Smyrna. We request assurance that Turkey will not attempt to disrupt British trade routes through the Dardanelles. In return, England will remain neutral in any disputes involving your control of the Aegean Sea. A mutually beneficial understanding is in both our interests.
TURKEY to ENGLAND: Herr England, your concerns regarding Smyrna are noted. We require control of the Dardanelles to secure our trade and maintain a strategic naval presence. In exchange for a non-interference agreement regarding Smyrna, Turkey offers to remain neutral in your dealings with Austria concerning Trieste. We believe this mutual restraint benefits both our nations.

Negotiation between FRANCE and RUSSIA:

Negotiation Turn 1 between FRANCE and RUSSIA:
FRANCE to RUSSIA: To Russia:

“Her Majesty’s Government recognizes the strategic importance of Sevastopol. We propose a non-aggression pact, focusing our efforts on securing the Adriatic. In return, we request assurances against Russian expansion in Italy.”
RUSSIA to FRANCE: To FRANCE:

“Her Majesty’s offer is noted. We require security for Sevastopol, and a commitment against German expansion into Italy. In return, Russia offers non-interference in the Adriatic. A stable Adriatic benefits all.”

Negotiation between ENGLAND and FRANCE:

Negotiation Turn 1 between ENGLAND and FRANCE:

FRANCE to ENGLAND: To England:

“France requests assurance that Germany will not attempt to seize St. Petersburg. In return, France offers to remain neutral regarding any future German ambitions in North Africa. A stable Mediterranean benefits all parties.”

Negotiation between ITALY and AUSTRIA:

Negotiation Turn 1 between ITALY and AUSTRIA:
ITALY to AUSTRIA: Greetings Austria, Our forces in the Adriatic are keenly aware of your holdings in Tri. We propose a non-aggression pact regarding Trieste – mutual recognition of its strategic importance and a commitment to avoid any actions that could destabilize the region. In return, we seek assurances that you will not attempt to expand into our sphere of influence in the Balkans. Let us discuss terms for a stable Adriatic.
AUSTRIA to ITALY: Herr Italien, Your offer regarding Trieste is… acceptable. We propose a mutual non-aggression pact concerning the Adriatic, with Austria-Hungary retaining Trieste and Italy acknowledging its strategic importance. In return, Italy agrees not to directly challenge Austrian influence in the Balkans. Let us proceed with this agreement – a stable Adriatic benefits both our nations.
